The first choice i had to do was wich type of token:
	
 	- I could go for a simple token that can represent value, they are the most common token they also know as cryptocurrency.
	- But i choose NFTs (non fungible token), they are used to represent something unique such as a piece of art or in-game collectible.

NFT was more vague for me so was more of a challenge

Now that i choose NFTs i need to choose the blockchain where i will deploy my smart contract on.
They are several point that help you choose one:
	
 	- First the blockchain need to let you write smart contract for NFT 
		- for example Bitcoin blockchain dont really let you create NFTs but Ordinals that are just a way to store datas on the blockchain
	- Then you can make a choice based on the popularity of the Blockchain
		- Ethereum is the leader in termes of NFTs
			- Solana is a newcomer in the ecosystem (2020) and have strength and weakness

	- You can also choose a blockchain on the fees associated
		- For exemple Solana could be a good option on those criteria because it have very low fees
	
	- Efficiency can be a good criteria
		- Solana in addition to be cheap is also super efficient

My choice fall on ethereum who have the strongest NFTs ecosystem and is very popular
I could make the choice of the new with Solana but is instability fear me a bit and i prefer the choice of stability
